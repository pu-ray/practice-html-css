<h1>MY FIRST ARTICLE </h1>
<h4>EDUCATIONS PURPOSE</h4>
<p>Revising is not something that should be hard or difficult at all .What revising is, unfortunately is time consuming .its takes a while, thatâ€™s why you need to start early to remain focused every day! Every minute!</p>
<p>Hard work is what determines our success of reaping and sowing. Most students forget a girl with a mind should do more with it than to think in that, if an open air market was opened outside, outside classes, selling wisdom, only the stupid could run the price.</p>
<p>Eat your books well, utilize your time so as you can shine and not be left in shame. Life is very much simple but we insist on making it complicated.</p>
<p>Conquers are many who are conquered by confusion who just came to pass time.although,this is stupidity of the highest order ,coz success is failure turned inside it.know how to keep your life in order coz success is failure turned inside it.know how to keep your life in order and have faith in God, in your work
Rumors will be spread by fools and accepted by idiolts of how you obey the rules eg.practising M.B.R, participating in class and they start giving you funny names.at long last gain is yours, lost is theirs. Working hard is a waste of time, what we should try and do is to try and work smart.<p>
