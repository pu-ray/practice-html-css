<h1>MY SECOND ARTICLE </h1>
<h4>THE MAJOR KEY TO YOUR BETTER FUTURE IS YOU</h4>
<p>We have gone through difficult times in our past life and we tend to define our future through the first experience. How unfortunate is this the truth is that the future you truly desire has nothing to do with your past experience .Don't thus use your deva sting past as the yardstick to the future you desire. There is absolutely no connection.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how you believe you think you arrived on this planet or under whose direction. The fact remains each of us has specific talents or gifts that are unique coded with our own d to help fulfil our purpose.</p>
<p>You must take charge of your success, you must take charge of your destiny. The success and the future you desire are simply in your hands .don’t wait for the government, church, spouse, government, economy, education, job or anything else outside yourself.</p>
<p>Too many people today look at the opportunity and figure out its someone else to make sure they got it.They look at financial ,security  and think that the government will make sure they live in retirement  or when incapacitated. They wait and wait, figuring it’s up to someone else to make them succeed and the wait is over, and it’s   too late to do anything. Their life is over and they are filled with regret .</p>
<p>It’s never too late success knows neither lateness nor earliness .success only knows timeliness 
You must start today .you have all the power neatly woven in your mind and the moment you start tapping onto this unlimited source of power by setting your own big dreams , believing in yourself and taking daily action , you will change your life forever.</p>
